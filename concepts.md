# Concepts

This documents relates to ideas for the new build of Starpeace, and is probably your best source for getting an idea of what
features and changes will exist in the new version, or at least may exist.

# Intro

This version of the game will maintain the current look and feel of the original game but will be crafted with a more dynamic
simulation, the idea being to "grow up" the simulator to be more realistic towards real life.

For example one pivotal concept of this build is that things like wages will be dynamic.

In the current version you can set wages on a sliding scale of 0 to 300, this is felt as too restrictive.
The new version of the game will incorporate calculations for average wage, this will help with population growth, population share and job desirability.

For example, the wage slider will become a slider with a fixed lower end of 0 but the top end will always be dynamic and fixed at the same time, the maximum amount will be set to two times the average wage the the class of worker, this means that as prosperity grows in your town, so will the ability to pay staff more for there work. This is more true to real life and will add an interesting new dynamic to the game.
