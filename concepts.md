# Concepts

This documents relates to ideas for the new build of Starpeace, and is probably your best source for getting an idea of what
features and changes will exist in the new version, or at least may exist.

# Intro

This version of the game will maintain the current look and feel of the original game but will be crafted with a more dynamic
simulation, the idea being to "grow up" the simulator to be more realistic towards real life.


# Average Wages

For example one pivotal concept of this build is that things like wages will be dynamic.

In the current version you can set wages on a sliding scale of 0 to 300, this is felt as too restrictive.
The new version of the game will incorporate calculations for average wage, this will help with population growth, population share and job desirability.

For example, the wage slider will become a slider with a fixed lower end of 0 but the top end will always be dynamic and fixed at the same time, the maximum amount will be set to two times the average wage the the class of worker, the average wage is calculated each tick, so will change with the economy, although your setting at the time will stay inplace. This means that as prosperity grows in your town, so will the ability to pay staff more for there work, and in a down turn your ability to pay staff more will be limited. This is more true to real life and will add an interesting new dynamic to the game. In normal world setup you will be able to lower wages, that wont be true in worlds for more advanced players where the ability to lower wages will be removed.

# Branding

Branding is a feature that we believe was missed in the original game, although the baseline concept is present with the use of television adverts for advertising. This is going to be brought up to date with the introduction of two diffferent medias which are... you guessed it newspapers and radio adverts.

Branding will also gain more traction in its effect to affect desirability, while the percentage of affect it has on desirability will be narrowed down as testing takes place, we are looking at it making up, up to 20% of the desirability of a commercial business, ofcourse branding will need to be maintained to get maximum use out of it and the power of branding will be reflected in the cost of it. Again this makes for a more realistic approach to desirability.

# Ecologically Friendly

This iteration of the game may include desirability factors based on how ecologically sound a business is, at the moment as an idea we are looking at it being an effect that will affect the desirability to all classes but will effect middle class and low class the same but it will be more important to the high class population.
