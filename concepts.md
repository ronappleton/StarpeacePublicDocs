# Concepts

This documents relates to ideas for the new build of Starpeace, and is probably your best source for getting an idea of what
features and changes will exist in the new version, or at least may exist.

# Intro

This version of the game will maintain the current look and feel of the original game but will be crafted with a more dynamic
simulation, the idea being to "grow up" the simulator to be more realistic towards real life.

For example one pivotal concept of this build is that things like wages will be dynamic.

In the current version you can set wages on a sliding scale of 0 to 300, this is felt as too restrictive.
